# Lean Engine

Lean Engine is my attempt at learning graphics programming. The goal is to create a 3D playground that allows me to easily interact and implement various graphics features. I started Lean Engine on OpenGL which is the repo you are currently viewing. I wrote over ~14 blogs documenting my journey as I went through [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) to learn and implement various features. After implementing a majority of the features [I decided to continue my progress in DirectX 11](https://github.com/matekdev/based-engine). Here is an incomplete list with direct links to the blog posts.
